This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A Simple Weather App

For this app, I wanted to get more muscle memory for using React. My goals were as follows:

1. It should show the 5-day weather forecast for Dallas, TX
2. Ability to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius
3. Should match a complimentary comp as closely as possible on desktop
4. Should be fully responsive
5. Icons should correspond to proper weather conditions
6. Use an open weather API
7. Include some kind of animation
